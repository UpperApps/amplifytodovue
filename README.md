# AWS Amplify Vue

This project is a study project with the following proposes:

1. Study the AWS Amplify resources to develop web app applications.
2. Understand how to integrate a SPA front-end application with a back-end Amplify application. To do that it will be used Vue.js as a front-end framework.
3. In a further work I intend to recreate the project using Firebase as a BaaS in order to compare the pros and cons when using each of these solutions.
